# Auth Service Phase-Out Plan

This document outlines the strategy for phasing out our custom authentication service and fully transitioning to Clerk.

## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Timeline | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Preparation & Planning | Week 1 | Not Started |
| 2 | Clerk Integration | Weeks 2-3 | Not Started |
| 3 | Dual Authentication Period | Weeks 4-6 | Not Started |
| 4 | Complete Transition | Weeks 7-8 | Not Started |
| 5 | Decommission Custom Auth | Week 9 | Not Started |

## Phase 1: Preparation & Planning

### Tasks:
- [x] Evaluate Clerk features and ensure they meet all requirements
- [x] Create integration plan for Clerk
- [x] Set up Clerk account and configure settings
- [x] Create database migration plan
- [x] Prepare user communication strategy
- [ ] Set up monitoring for authentication-related issues

### Deliverables:
- Clerk configuration document
- Database migration scripts
- User communication templates
- Monitoring dashboard for auth metrics

## Phase 2: Clerk Integration

### Tasks:
- [x] Implement Clerk authentication in frontend
- [x] Create middleware for backend services
- [x] Set up webhook handlers for user events
- [ ] Implement user migration script
- [ ] Run migration in staging environment
- [ ] Test all authentication flows with Clerk
- [ ] Update documentation for developers

### Deliverables:
- Working Clerk integration in staging environment
- Successful user migration in staging
- Updated developer documentation
- Test reports for all authentication flows

## Phase 3: Dual Authentication Period

During this phase, both authentication systems will be operational. New users will use Clerk, while existing users can continue using the current system or opt-in to Clerk.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Deploy Clerk integration to production
- [ ] Run user migration script in production
- [ ] Implement feature flag for Clerk authentication
- [ ] Add opt-in option for existing users to switch to Clerk
- [ ] Monitor authentication metrics and issues
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Gradually increase percentage of users on Clerk

### Deliverables:
- Production deployment of Clerk integration
- User migration report
- Feature flag implementation
- User feedback summary
- Authentication metrics dashboard

## Phase 4: Complete Transition

### Tasks:
- [ ] Set Clerk as the default authentication method for all users
- [ ] Redirect all authentication requests to Clerk
- [ ] Update all documentation to reference only Clerk
- [ ] Ensure all users have been migrated
- [ ] Run final tests on all authentication flows
- [ ] Prepare for custom auth service shutdown

### Deliverables:
- 100% of users on Clerk authentication
- Updated documentation
- Final migration report
- Test reports for all authentication flows

## Phase 5: Decommission Custom Auth

### Tasks:
- [ ] Stop all custom auth service instances
- [ ] Archive custom auth service code
- [ ] Remove custom auth service infrastructure
- [ ] Update monitoring to remove custom auth metrics
- [ ] Conduct post-migration review

### Deliverables:
- Decommissioning report
- Infrastructure cost savings report
- Post-migration review document

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks:
1. **User Migration Failures**: Some users may fail to migrate properly.
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing, backup plans, and manual migration process for edge cases.

2. **Authentication Disruptions**: Users may experience login issues during transition.
   - Mitigation: Dual authentication period, gradual rollout, and quick rollback capability.

3. **Integration Issues**: Clerk may not integrate seamlessly with all services.
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing in staging, service-by-service rollout.

4. **User Resistance**: Users may be confused or resistant to the change.
   - Mitigation: Clear communication, easy opt-in process, and responsive support.

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise during the transition, we will:

1. Revert to the custom auth service as the primary authentication method
2. Fix issues in the Clerk integration
3. Retry the transition with an updated plan

## Communication Plan

### Internal Stakeholders:
- Weekly status updates to development team
- Bi-weekly updates to management
- Documentation updates for all developers

### Users:
- Announcement email 2 weeks before transition begins
- In-app notifications during the dual authentication period
- Follow-up email when transition is complete
- Support articles explaining the change and benefits

## Success Metrics

We will consider this transition successful when:

1. 100% of active users are authenticated through Clerk
2. Authentication-related support tickets are at or below pre-transition levels
3. All services are properly integrated with Clerk
4. Custom auth service has been fully decommissioned
5. No authentication disruptions for at least 2 weeks post-transition
